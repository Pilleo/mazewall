# mazewall-enforcer

**Core runtime engine for thread-scoped and process-wide syscall sandboxing.**

This subproject implements unprivileged sandboxing using Linux **Seccomp-BPF** and **Landlock LSM** through the JDK **Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API** (JDK 22+). It is designed to be a zero-dependency, high-performance security layer for production JVM services.

---

## Technical Architecture

- **FFM Native Bindings:** Uses the JDK Foreign Function & Memory API to map native Linux system calls directly from Kotlin, eliminating the need for JNI or dynamic C library dependencies.
- **BPF Program Compilation:** Generates deterministic BPF instruction arrays. The compiler uses an inverted linear scan to handle complex syscall policies within the 8-bit seccomp relative jump limitation.
- **Thread-Scoped Enforcement:** Applies filters to individual OS threads via `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, ...)`. Filters are inherited by child threads created after installation.
- **Filesystem & Network Isolation:** Integrates Landlock LSM to restrict filesystem paths and TCP ports. It automatically handles Landlock ABI negotiation and authorizes the JVM classpath for lazy classloading.
- **Atomic Synchronization (`TSYNC`):** Leverages the `SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC` flag to synchronize filters across all existing threads in the process during initialization.

## Installation

Add `mazewall-enforcer` to your project via **JitPack** or **GitHub Packages**.

### Gradle (Kotlin)

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.Pilleo.jseccomp:enforcer:main-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

## Core API Usage

The primary entry point is `ContainedExecutors`, which provides wrappers for standard `ExecutorService` instances.

### 1. Wrapping an Executor

```kotlin
import io.mazewall.enforcer.ContainedExecutors
import io.mazewall.Policy

val policy = Policy.builder()
    .base(Policy.NO_EXEC)
    .allowFsRead("/var/tmp/incoming")
    .allowJvmClasspath()
    .build()

val sandboxed = ContainedExecutors.wrap(
    Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4),
    policy
)
```

### 2. Process-Wide Baseline

```kotlin
// Apply a NO_EXEC baseline to the entire JVM process early in main()
ContainedExecutors.installOnProcess(Policy.NO_EXEC)
```

## Critical Safety Invariants

To prevent JVM deadlocks and stability issues, `:enforcer` implements several internal safeguards:

- **Loom Carrier Protection:** Seccomp filters bind to OS threads. `:enforcer` detects if installation is attempted within a Virtual Thread (Loom) and throws `IllegalStateException` to prevent poisoning shared carrier threads.
- **Coordination Whitelisting:** JVM coordination syscalls (`futex`, `sched_yield`, `rt_sigreturn`, `madvise`, `gettid`, etc.) are always whitelisted. Blocking these syscalls would deadlock the JVM during GC safepoints.
- **Initialization Ordering:** Landlock rulesets are always initialized before Seccomp filters, as active Seccomp rules would otherwise block the Landlock configuration syscalls.

## Testing

Tests require a Linux host (6.2+) or the provided dev container environment.

```bash
./gradlew :enforcer:check
```
