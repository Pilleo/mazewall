# Contained: The Attacks jseccomp Actually Stops

> **Series overview:** This is Part 3 of a 4-part series on behavioral security for cloud-native applications.


Parts 1 and 2 built the conceptual and architectural case. Now we run the attacks.

This article shows — with actual syscall sequences, policy definitions, and kernel output — exactly what `jseccomp` blocks and why. All examples are runnable from the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leanid/jseccomp.git
cd jseccomp
# Linux x86_64 or aarch64, JDK 22+
# Docker needed for nested seccomp (see Part 2 for the reason)
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec jseccomp ./gradlew test
```

## Attack 1: Log4Shell-Style RCE (Shell Injection)

**The attack:** An attacker sends a crafted JNDI payload to a vulnerable logger. The logger deserializes the payload and calls `Runtime.exec()`, which chains into `execve()` to spawn `/bin/sh` or run `touch /tmp/pwned`.

**The syscall sequence:**

```
Thread-1 (worker, processing untrusted input)
  VulnerableLogger.log("${jndi:...cmd=touch,/tmp/pwned}")
    → ProcessBuilder.start()
      → ProcessImpl.forkAndExec()
        → execve("/bin/touch", ["touch", "/tmp/pwned"], ...)
          ← EPERM  ← seccomp filter: NO_EXEC blocks execve()
```

**The demo:** `VulnerableLogger` in the `demo` module directly simulates this gadget chain.

```kotlin
// demo/src/main/kotlin/demo/VulnerableLogger.kt
object VulnerableLogger {
    fun log(input: String): String {
        if (input.startsWith("\${jndi:")) {
            val command = extractCommand(input)
            ProcessBuilder(*command)   // execve() call site
                .inheritIO()
                .start()               // ← kernel blocks here with EPERM
                .waitFor(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        }
        return "Logged: $input"
    }
}
```

**Without containment** (`ExploitDemonstrationTest`):
```
UnsafeRunner.run("${jndi:...cmd=touch,/tmp/pwned_unsafe}")
→ /tmp/pwned_unsafe exists ✓  (attack succeeded)
```

**With containment** (`ProtectionDemonstrationTest`):
```kotlin
val safeExecutor = ContainedExecutors.wrap(
    Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(),
    Policy.NO_EXEC
)
val future = safeExecutor.submit { vulnerableLogger.log(payload) }
future.get()
// throws ExecutionException { cause: ContainmentViolationException:
//   "Task violated containment policy" }
// /tmp/pwned_safe does NOT exist
```

The kernel intercepts `execve()` in the worker thread and returns `EPERM`. The JVM surfaces this as `IOException("error=1, ...")`, which `ContainedExecutors` detects and wraps as `ContainmentViolationException`. The attacker's command never runs.

## Attack 2: Fileless Malware (`memfd_create` + `execveat`)

**The attack:** A more sophisticated attacker avoids `execve` entirely. Instead:

1. Call `memfd_create("payload", MFD_CLOEXEC)` → get an anonymous in-memory file descriptor (no path, no disk entry)
2. Write a full ELF binary into the memfd via `write(fd, elf_bytes, size)`
3. Call `execveat(fd, "", argv, envp, AT_EMPTY_PATH)` → execute the in-memory binary

No file ever touches disk. `ls /proc/self/fd/` shows the fd, but there is no filesystem path for a scanner to find. This technique defeats all disk-based security tooling.

**The syscall sequence:**
```
Thread-1 (worker, attacker has RCE)
  memfd_create("payload\0", MFD_CLOEXEC)
    ← EPERM  ← seccomp filter: NO_EXEC blocks memfd_create()
```

`jseccomp` blocks `memfd_create` in `NO_EXEC` and `PURE_COMPUTE` policies because the standard JVM has no legitimate use for it in worker threads. The attack is stopped at step 1 — before any binary data is even staged.

**Verified by test** (`MemfdCreateBypassTest`):

```kotlin
@Test
fun `NO_EXEC blocks memfd_create as of recent security update`() {
    val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
    executor.submit {
        ContainedExecutors.installOnCurrentThread(Policy.NO_EXEC)

        val arch = Arch.current()
        val res = Arena.ofConfined().use { arena ->
            val name = arena.allocateFrom("test_memfd")
            LinuxNative.syscall(arch.memfdCreate.toLong(), name.address(), 0L, MemorySegment.NULL)
        }
        assertTrue(res.returnValue < 0, "memfd_create should be blocked by NO_EXEC")
        assertTrue(res.errno == LinuxNative.EPERM, "Expected EPERM, got ${res.errno}")
    }.get()
}
```

The test calls the kernel directly via FFM, bypassing all Java wrappers — the `EPERM` comes straight from the seccomp filter.

## Attack 3: Binary Shellcode Injection (`mmap PROT_EXEC`)

**The attack:** An attacker with arbitrary write primitives (buffer overflow, unsafe memory access) writes machine code into the process address space and marks the target region executable:

```c
void *region = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
memcpy(region, shellcode, size);
mprotect(region, size, PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC);  // make it executable
((void(*)())region)();                           // jump to shellcode
```

**Why this is hard to block naively:** The JVM's JIT compiler does exactly this — allocates memory, writes compiled native code, marks it executable. A filter that blocks all `mmap(PROT_EXEC)` crashes the JVM immediately.

**How `jseccomp` handles it:** BPF argument inspection. The filter loads the `prot` argument from the syscall context and checks the `PROT_EXEC` bit (0x4):

```
Worker Thread (contained, Policy.PURE_COMPUTE)
  mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON, -1, 0)
    → prot = 0x3, PROT_EXEC bit (0x4) not set → ALLOWED

  mprotect(region, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC)
    → prot = 0x5, PROT_EXEC bit (0x4) IS set → EPERM

JIT Thread (uncontained — different OS thread)
  mmap(NULL, 65536, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_ANON, -1, 0)
    → no filter on this thread → ALLOWED (JIT functions normally)
```

The contained worker thread cannot create executable memory. The JIT thread — on a different OS thread with no filter — is completely unaffected.

**Verified by test** (`MmapProtectionTest`):
```kotlin
@Test
fun `PURE_COMPUTE blocks mmap with PROT_EXEC`() {
    val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
    executor.submit {
        ContainedExecutors.installOnCurrentThread(Policy.PURE_COMPUTE)
        // Attempt to create executable memory
        val result = LinuxNative.mmap(
            MemorySegment.NULL, 4096,
            LinuxNative.PROT_READ or LinuxNative.PROT_EXEC,
            LinuxNative.MAP_ANON or LinuxNative.MAP_PRIVATE,
            -1, 0
        )
        assertTrue(result.returnValue < 0)
        assertTrue(result.errno == LinuxNative.EPERM)
    }.get()
}
```

## Attack 4: io_uring Evasion

**The attack:** `io_uring` was designed for high-throughput I/O but has become a documented security evasion vector. Operations submitted to an `io_uring` ring (reads, writes, accepts, even `execve` via `IORING_OP_EXECVE`) are dispatched from kernel-side worker threads, not the submitting thread. From a Seccomp perspective:

- The submitting thread calls `io_uring_setup()` and `io_uring_enter()` — these are the only visible syscalls
- The actual operations (open, connect, sendmsg, etc.) execute in kernel context and do not generate per-operation seccomp events on the submitting thread

A sophisticated attacker who has already compromised a worker thread can set up an `io_uring` ring and submit file-reads, network connects, and process spawns — operations that would be blocked if called directly — through the ring.

**The `jseccomp` response:** Block `io_uring_setup` entirely in `NO_EXEC` and `PURE_COMPUTE` policies. A JVM worker thread processing JSON or images has no legitimate use for `io_uring`. The standard JVM uses `epoll` + NIO, not `io_uring`, for its internal I/O.

```kotlin
// From Policy.kt — NO_EXEC definition
val NO_EXEC: Policy = builder()
    .block(Syscall.EXECVE, Syscall.EXECVEAT)
    .block(Syscall.FORK, Syscall.VFORK)
    .block(Syscall.MEMFD_CREATE, Syscall.IO_URING_SETUP, Syscall.PTRACE)
    .block(Syscall.INIT_MODULE, Syscall.FINIT_MODULE)
    .build()
```

> *The mental model from `SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS.md`:* **eBPF sees the action; Seccomp only sees the ring.** Because Seccomp cannot peer into the shared memory ring buffer, the only safe response is to prevent the ring from being created.

## Attack 5: Kernel Module Injection (LPE Vector)

**The attack:** An attacker who has compromised a worker thread seeks local privilege escalation (LPE) to break out of the container. A common modern Linux LPE strategy is to trigger the dynamic loading of obscure, vulnerable kernel modules (such as DCCP, RDS, SCTP, or old filesystem drivers) by calling `socket()` with unusual families or calling `mount()`. The kernel automatically fires off `modprobe` / `kmod` to load the dormant module, exposing the kernel's vulnerable attack surface. Alternatively, if the container holds administrative capabilities (`CAP_SYS_MODULE`), the attacker can attempt to load a malicious rootkit directly using `init_module` or `finit_module`.

**The jseccomp response:** Block module-loading syscalls completely.

A JVM worker pool handling REST requests, parsing XML, or compiling reports has **zero** legitimate business loading kernel modules. By adding `Syscall.INIT_MODULE` and `Syscall.FINIT_MODULE` to our `NO_EXEC` and `PURE_COMPUTE` presets, we neutralize this dynamic injection vector at the thread level. Even if an exploit achieves capabilities within the container namespace, the kernel blocks the module load with `EPERM`.

### The Host-Level Counterpart: ModuleJail

This application-level sandboxing mirrors a brilliant emerging trend in host-level hardening: **ModuleJail** (developed by Jasper Nuyens, as featured on OpenNet). 

While `jseccomp` blocks module-loading syscalls *inside the JVM thread*, `ModuleJail` operates at the host OS layer to scan running systems for dormant kernel modules and automatically blacklist them. 

This creates a perfect **Defense-in-Depth sandwich**:
1. **At the Host Layer:** `ModuleJail` locks down the OS kernel, ensuring vulnerable legacy modules can never be loaded system-wide.
2. **At the JVM Layer:** `jseccomp` blocks the syscall channels (`socket` families, `mount`, `init_module`) that an attacker would use to trigger dynamic kernel transitions in the first place.

## Filesystem Attacks and Landlock

The attacks above all operate at the syscall mechanism level. But an attacker with file-read access on a compromised thread can still read sensitive data without triggering any of the above blocks — they can call `openat("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY)` directly, and `openat` is not blocked in `NO_EXEC` or `NO_NETWORK` policies.

Landlock addresses this at the inode level:

```kotlin
val policy = Policy.builder()
    .base(Policy.PURE_COMPUTE)
    .allowJvmClasspath()             // required — see Part 2
    .allowFsRead("/data/incoming")   // only this directory
    .allowFsWrite("/data/processed") // and this one
    .build()

val executor = ContainedExecutors.wrap(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4), policy)

executor.submit {
    // Works:
    File("/data/incoming/task.json").readText()
    File("/data/processed/result.json").writeText(output)

    // Blocked by Landlock (EACCES):
    File("/etc/passwd").readText()
    File("/var/run/docker.sock").readText()
}.get()
```

Landlock uses `O_NOFOLLOW` when opening path descriptors — symlinks are rejected (`ELOOP`) to prevent an attacker who controls a symlink target from redirecting a Landlock rule to an unintended path.

## The Inherited File Descriptor Caveat

Seccomp `NO_NETWORK` blocks the *creation* of new network connections: `socket()`, `connect()`, `bind()`. It does not block `read()`, `write()`, or `sendmsg()` on *already-open* file descriptors.

If a worker thread inherits an open socket from a previous task (or receives one via `SCM_RIGHTS` before containment is applied), it can still communicate over that socket after containment. `NO_NETWORK` prevents new channels from being opened — it does not isolate pre-existing ones.

The defense: always create a fresh thread pool for contained tasks, never reuse threads that previously held uncontained sockets, and apply process-wide `NO_EXEC` to ensure the base process also can't establish new privileged channels.

---

## The Policy Matrix

| Attack vector | Blocked by | Policy needed |
|---|---|---|
| Shell injection (`execve`) | Seccomp arg-pass | `NO_EXEC` |
| Fileless malware (`memfd_create` + `execveat`) | Seccomp | `NO_EXEC` |
| Shellcode injection (`mmap PROT_EXEC`) | Seccomp BPF arg inspection | `PURE_COMPUTE` |
| io_uring evasion | Seccomp (`io_uring_setup`) | `NO_EXEC` |
| Kernel module injection (`init_module`, `finit_module`) | Seccomp | `NO_EXEC` |
| Network exfiltration (`connect`, `socket`) | Seccomp | `NO_NETWORK` |
| Filesystem snooping (`/etc/passwd`) | Landlock | Custom policy |
| Pivot to docker socket | Landlock | Custom policy |

## What jseccomp Does Not Stop

- **ROP/JOP gadget chains** — reusing existing mapped code. Requires ASLR + CFI.
- **In-process heap reads** — a contained thread still shares the JVM heap and can read any object it can reach.
- **Pre-established network channels** — inherited open file descriptors.
- **Orchestrator-level escapes** — if the JVM user has write access to `/etc/cron.d/` or the Docker socket, those escapes happen outside the syscall filter.

`jseccomp` is one defense layer in a stack, not a total sandbox.
