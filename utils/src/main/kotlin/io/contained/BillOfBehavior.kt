/**
 * An immutable record of what kernel-level operations were observed during a
 * profiling run. This is the raw output of the [Profiler] — completely decoupled
 * from any [Policy].
 *
 * Field naming follows the [Software Bill of Behavior (SBoB) spec draft v0.0.1](https://billofbehavior.com/bob/docs/drafts/spec-v0.0.1/):
 * - [opens]   → SBoB §4.6 `opens`
 * - [execs]   → SBoB §4.5 `execs`
 * - [syscalls] → non-standard extension; all intercepted syscall names
 *
 * ## Absent vs Explicit-Empty
 * Per SBoB §5.4, absent (null) means "unconstrained / not observed" and
 * explicit empty (emptySet()) means "observed zero activity". This class
 * always returns empty sets (never null), because a completed profiling run
 * with zero observations is a valid, meaningful result: the operation touched
 * nothing in that category.
 *
 * ## Stack profiles
 * [stackProfile] captures per-syscall JVM stack traces on a best-effort basis.
 * The worker thread is frozen in the kernel during USER_NOTIF; its Java stack
 * is stable at that moment. Frames are Java-only — no kernel frames are available.
 * This is a precursor to the SBoB stack-profile extension (spec-stackprofile-v0.0.1,
 * not yet published). The encoding will align to OTel Profiles when that extension
 * stabilises.
 *
 * ## Composability
 * Use [plus] to merge two bills from separate profiling runs into a single policy.
