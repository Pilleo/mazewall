# Thread-Scoped Syscall Containment in the JVM: Architecture and Trade-offs

> **Series overview:** This is Part 2 of a 4-part series on behavioral security for cloud-native applications. **What this part adds:** the mechanics of thread-scoped seccomp inside a live JVM — safepoint deadlock risks, JIT memory protection, Loom carrier contamination, and exactly where the model breaks.


In Part 1, we established that the Linux kernel gives us three unprivileged enforcement primitives — Seccomp, Landlock, and (for platform agents) BPF-LSM — and that a Software Bill of Behavior (SBoB) describes what software is *expected* to do so these primitives have something authoritative to enforce.

Now we get practical. The JVM is one of the most capability-rich processes in the modern data center. Let's examine why the standard approach to securing it leaves significant attack surface, and how thread-scoped enforcement closes the gap.

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Architecture Note: The Native Bridge, FFM, and the Errno Race</b></summary>

Before we dive into the kernel, we must address how the JVM talks to it. Historically, this required **JNI (Java Native Interface)**—a complex, slow, and often unsafe bridge involving C header generation and manual memory management.

`jseccomp` is built on the modern **Java FFM (Foreign Function & Memory) API**, finalized as a standard feature in Java 22. FFM allows us to invoke native system calls (`prctl`, `seccomp`, `landlock_create_ruleset`) directly from Kotlin/Java with near-native performance and type safety, without writing a single line of C code.

However, interfacing with the kernel from a managed runtime introduces a subtle but critical engineering challenge: **the `errno` race condition.**

In Linux, `errno` is a thread-local variable that stores the error code of the most recent system call. In a standard C program, reading `errno` immediately after a failed call is straightforward. In a JVM, however, the runtime is constantly performing its own native operations (GC write barriers, safepoint polls, JIT bookkeeping) on the same OS thread. 

If we make a system call and then attempt to read `errno` via a second FFM call, there is a high probability that the JVM's internal activity will clobber the `errno` value before we can retrieve it.

`jseccomp` handles this using the FFM `Linker.Option.captureCallState("errno")` feature. This tells the JVM to generate a specialized native "stub" that atomically captures the `errno` value into a protected memory segment the instant the system call returns, ensuring we see the kernel's true response rather than JVM-internal noise.

## Why Not BPF-LSM?

Before anything else: if you've been following kernel security, your first question is probably *"why Seccomp and not BPF-LSM?"*

BPF-LSM is unambiguously more powerful. While Seccomp sees raw pointer arguments as passed in registers, it cannot safely dereference them — a separate thread can modify the string a pointer refers to between the moment Seccomp inspects the register and the moment the kernel actually uses the value. This is the classic TOCTOU (time-of-check/time-of-use) pattern, and it means Seccomp cannot safely enforce path-based decisions. BPF-LSM hooks *after* kernel objects are fully resolved — it inspects the canonical path `/etc/passwd`, the resolved destination IP, the resolved inode. It enables complex, context-aware enforcement that Seccomp cannot match.

**The architectural blocker is privilege.** Loading a BPF-LSM program requires `CAP_BPF` or `CAP_MAC_ADMIN`. A production JVM running as a non-root user in a container should never hold these capabilities. Using BPF-LSM for application-level self-restriction means deploying a highly privileged node agent (a Kubernetes DaemonSet) to manage policies on the JVM's behalf — a significant operational dependency.

Seccomp and Landlock are **self-restriction primitives**. With `NoNewPrivileges` set, any thread can unilaterally strip its own capabilities — no agents, no cluster-level permissions. `jseccomp` requires zero external infrastructure. That architectural purity has a cost (TOCTOU on path inspection), but it's the right trade-off for developer-driven "shift left" security.

## The Global Sandbox Fallacy

The standard approach to JVM security is a global seccomp profile applied to the entire Linux process — the Podman/Docker default profile, an AppArmor policy on the pod, or a custom seccomp JSON in the `securityContext`.

This is not worthless. The default OCI profile already blocks ~40 dangerous syscalls: `keyctl`, `add_key`, `request_key`, `ptrace` in certain modes, and others. That baseline matters.

**But the remaining allowed syscalls are the problem.** A typical Spring Boot application — even after Podman/Docker's default restrictions — still requires:
- `socket` + `connect` + `sendmsg` for its API and database connections
- `openat` + `read` for reading config files and loading classes
- `mmap` with `PROT_EXEC` for the JIT compiler to generate native code

Because the *process* needs these capabilities, *every thread* in the process has them — including threads processing untrusted data.

When an attacker triggers an RCE vulnerability (Log4Shell, a deserialization gadget chain, an XXE payload that reaches JNDI), they inherit the full capability set of the worker thread. They don't need to escape the container. They can use the network socket the JVM already has open to exfiltrate data, the filesystem access it already has to read `/etc/passwd`, the process execution it already has to... wait, that's where it gets interesting.

---

## The Solution: Tiered Enforcement

The Linux kernel provides a capability that is underutilized: **Seccomp filters can be applied per-thread.**

`jseccomp` is built around a two-tier model:

**Tier 1 — Global Process Lockdown:** At application startup, apply `Policy.NO_EXEC` to the entire JVM process via `ContainedExecutors.installOnProcess()`. This permanently disables shell spawning (`execve`, `execveat`, `fork`, `vfork`, `memfd_create`) for every thread, present and future.

This mimics the approach Elasticsearch has used in production for years — a minimal, process-wide filter that renders Log4Shell-style RCE toothless. The attacker can reach your vulnerable code; they simply cannot spawn a shell. The filter is permanent and cannot be undone.

**Tier 2 — Surgical Thread Containment:** For specific worker pools handling untrusted data — JSON parsers, image processors, XML deserializers, report generators — apply stricter policies. `ContainedExecutors.wrap()` creates an `ExecutorService` decorator that installs the chosen policy on each worker thread before it runs its first task. These restrictions are permanent for the lifetime of that thread.

### The Shared-Memory ACE Escape Caveat

It is critical to understand the threat model of thread-scoped enforcement. Because all JVM threads share the same physical address space (the heap and class metadata), a thread-scoped sandbox is **not an impenetrable boundary against an attacker who achieves Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)**.

If an attacker gains full native code execution within a sandboxed worker thread, they can theoretically bypass the thread-level filter by writing a malicious task directly into the memory of an uncontained, global thread pool (like the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`). This is exactly why `jseccomp` mandates **Tier 1 (Process-wide lockdown)** as the foundational backstop. Tier 2 provides surgical, low-overhead protection against data-driven attacks (SSRF, XXE, Path Traversal), but Tier 1 ensures the attacker cannot escalate to process execution regardless of which thread they compromise.

```kotlin
// Global lockdown at startup — all threads, forever
ContainedExecutors.installOnProcess(Policy.NO_EXEC)

// Per-pool surgical restriction for untrusted-data workers
val imageProcessor = ContainedExecutors.wrap(
    Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4),
    Policy.PURE_COMPUTE  // no network, no file open, no exec, no mmap(PROT_EXEC)
)
```

## Stopping Shellcode Without Breaking the JIT

The JVM's JIT compiler is the most obvious obstacle to strict memory protection. The JIT must call `mmap` with `PROT_EXEC` to allocate executable memory for optimized native code. A naive Seccomp filter blocking all `PROT_EXEC` will crash the JVM immediately.

`jseccomp` solves this with **BPF argument inspection**. The library generates a cBPF filter that inspects the arguments of `mmap` and `mprotect` so the JIT can work but shellcode cannot.

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Deep Dive: How the BPF Filter Distinguishes JIT from Shellcode</b></summary>

Classic BPF (cBPF), the filter dialect used by Seccomp, operates on a fixed structure called `struct seccomp_data`. This structure exposes the syscall number (`nr`) and up to six 64-bit arguments (`args[0]`–`args[5]`). BPF programs use relative-offset jump instructions to build decision trees; there are no named labels — all branching uses byte offsets, computed at filter-assembly time.

The filter generated by `jseccomp` does the following:
1. **Check if the syscall is `mmap` (9) or `mprotect` (10)** on x86_64. If it is neither, allow unconditionally.
2. **Load `args[2]`** — the `prot` argument — as a 32-bit word from the structure.
3. **Test the `PROT_EXEC` bit (0x4)**. If the bit is set, return `SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO | EPERM`. If not set, allow the mapping.

The key insight: the JIT allocates executable memory only on JIT compiler threads — which are separate OS threads *not* covered by the worker thread's Seccomp filter. Worker threads processing untrusted data have no legitimate reason to set `PROT_EXEC`. The filter checks precisely the bit that separates "JIT allocating native code" from "shellcode marking memory executable."

> **32-bit truncation note:** BPF operates on 32-bit words. The filter loads the lower 32 bits of `prot`. Since the Linux kernel only honors the standard lower bits defined in POSIX for protection flags, this truncation is architecturally correct.
</details>

Because this filter is applied only to contained worker threads, JIT threads running on the same JVM continue operating without restriction. Shellcode execution is surgically neutralized — thread-scoped, zero JVM stability impact.

## The GC and Safepoint Deadlock Risk

Applying extreme restrictions like `Policy.PURE_COMPUTE` inside a HotSpot JVM comes with a massive, implicit runtime risk: **Safepoints and GC cycles.**

A JVM thread is never a completely isolated island. Periodically, the JVM pauses application threads to perform Garbage Collection, generate thread dumps, or execute runtime optimizations (safepoints). To coordinate these operations, application threads must run JVM runtime code, which frequently invokes system calls for synchronization and resource management:
* `futex` for native lock acquisition and thread waking.
* `sched_yield` to relinquish CPU slices during contention.
* `rt_sigreturn` to exit from signals triggered by safepoint interrupts.

If a custom `jseccomp` policy aggressively blocks these utility system calls in a worker thread, the thread will fail to coordinate during the next JVM safepoint. The result is a **catastrophic, VM-wide deadlock or immediate JVM crash**.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Extensive Testing Mandatory.** When creating custom policies, you must never block core JVM synchronization and scheduling primitives. Your policies must be tested under heavy thread contention, high-throughput garbage collection, and active thread dumps in staging environments before any consideration of non-production deployment.

## Native vs. JIT Strictness: GraalVM's Advantage

This safepoint deadlock risk exposes a fundamental difference in sandboxing strictness between **JIT-compiled HotSpot JVMs** and **AOT-compiled GraalVM Native Images**:

1. **HotSpot JVM (JIT):** Requires a highly permissive system call floor. Because HotSpot dynamically compiles native code, manages dynamic classloading, and performs complex runtime optimizations, application threads running in HotSpot require access to dynamic memory allocation, thread signaling, and logging.
2. **GraalVM Native Image (AOT):** Can run under an extremely restrictive system call floor. A native binary compiles directly to an ahead-of-time machine executable. It has no JIT compiler thread, no dynamic classloader, and a highly streamlined runtime garbage collector. 

This means that for pure mathematical computation or isolated data parsing tasks, a **GraalVM native binary can safely block system calls that a standard HotSpot JVM would require to avoid crashing**. If you need absolute syscall minimization, compiling to a Native Image is your most resilient path.

## The Limits: ROP and JOP

Blocking `mmap(PROT_EXEC)` prevents the *introduction of new malicious code* (shellcode). It does not stop an attacker who reuses *existing* code already mapped in the JVM's address space.

**Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)** and **Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP)** chain together short existing code sequences ("gadgets") from the JVM binary, loaded libraries, and the JDK itself. These chains can implement arbitrary computation without ever calling `mmap` or `mprotect`. Seccomp cannot see CPU instruction flow — only syscalls.

This is not a flaw in `jseccomp`; it is the honest limit of the syscall interception model. The complementary defenses are:
- **ASLR** — randomizes the base addresses of loaded code, making gadget chain addresses unpredictable
- **Stack Canaries** — detect stack corruption before a ROP chain can pivot
- **CFI (Control Flow Integrity)** — hardware enforcement of valid branch targets (Intel CET Shadow Stacks, ARM BTI)

Seccomp is the lock on the door for *new* code. ASLR + CFI are the internal sensors for gadget chain attacks.

## Seccomp + Landlock: The Complete Picture

Seccomp's TOCTOU vulnerability for path inspection (it sees raw pointers, not resolved paths) means it cannot safely enforce "this thread may only read from `/app/data`."

**Landlock** fills that gap. It provides path-aware filesystem access control at the inode level, with the same zero-privilege profile as Seccomp. `jseccomp` combines both:

```kotlin
val policy = Policy.builder()
    .base(Policy.PURE_COMPUTE)
    .allowJvmClasspath()          // allow lazy classloading (critical — see below)
    .allowFsRead("/data/incoming")
    .allowFsWrite("/data/processed")
    .build()

val executor = ContainedExecutors.wrap(
    Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4),
    policy
)
```

**Critical JVM gotcha:** Landlock is applied at the OS thread level, permanently. If a restricted worker thread is the first to trigger the JVM's lazy classloading for a new class, the JVM will attempt to open the `.jar` or `.class` file from the classpath. If Landlock blocks that read, the JVM throws `NoClassDefFoundError`. `allowJvmClasspath()` pre-authorizes `java.home` and all classpath entries to prevent this. Calling it is not optional when using Landlock.

Unlike Seccomp's `TSYNC` flag (`SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC`), Landlock's `landlock_restrict_self` only affects the calling thread. `TSYNC` is an *opt-in* mechanism that synchronises a newly installed filter to **all threads in the thread group, including those created after the call** — but it fails hard (throwing `IllegalStateException`) if any other thread already has an incompatible filter stack. It is not a "Seccomp applies everywhere automatically" switch, and failures are never silently ignored.

True process-wide Landlock has two practical paths:
1. Apply the ruleset from a single-threaded launcher *before* spawning any JVM threads — all threads inherit the restriction from birth without requiring a pre-`execve` wrapper.
2. Apply the ruleset *before* `execve`-ing the JVM from a shell launcher, so the restriction is inherited across the exec boundary.

Path 1 is often simpler for library-level use.

## Internal Micro-segmentation: Scalpel vs. Shield

A common question: *"If I already run Kubescape or Falco cluster-wide, why do I need thread-level containment?"*

The answer is Defense-in-Depth, and the distinction is *visibility*.

Cluster-wide tools see your container as a black box. They observe the process boundary — what syscalls the JVM process makes, what network connections it opens. They cannot see *which thread inside the JVM* is making those calls, *which library* is on the call stack, or *what data* triggered the behavior. A worker thread processing a malicious JSON payload looks identical to a thread processing a legitimate request from the outside.

`jseccomp` applies restrictions based on internal application logic that no external orchestrator can see. The cluster-wide tool is the building's perimeter security; `jseccomp` is the lock on each individual safe inside.

## Beyond Java: The Scheduler Constraint

The principles here are universal, but thread-level enforcement is only meaningful if there is a stable 1:1 mapping between your application's concurrency primitive and an OS thread.

**Go goroutines:** Go's M:N scheduler multiplexes thousands of goroutines onto a small pool of OS threads. If you apply a Seccomp filter to an OS thread to sandbox one goroutine, the Go runtime may schedule a different, completely unrelated goroutine onto that "poisoned" thread — which then crashes the moment it attempts a syscall the previous goroutine was forbidden from using. `runtime.LockOSThread()` prevents scheduling but cripples Go's concurrency model. `GOMAXPROCS=1` technically avoids cross-thread contamination (there is only one OS thread), but eliminates all parallelism — it is unusable for any concurrent workload. Thread-level containment is currently impractical for Go.

**Java virtual threads (Project Loom, Java 21+):** Loom's virtual threads have exactly the same M:N scheduler problem as Go goroutines. Virtual threads are scheduled onto a carrier thread pool (by default, a `ForkJoinPool`). 
If a task running on a virtual thread installs a seccomp filter on its current thread, it sandboxes the underlying **OS carrier thread**. When that task completes or yields, the carrier thread remains permanently restricted. Any subsequent virtual thread scheduled onto that carrier—even one running a completely unrelated, high-privilege administrative task—will inherit those restrictions and crash or fail.

To prevent this critical "carrier contamination," `jseccomp` detects virtual threads at runtime and immediately throws `IllegalStateException` with a clear diagnostic message:

```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Attempted to apply seccomp containment inside a virtual thread.
Use a dedicated platform thread pool and install containment on its carrier threads instead.
```

**Rust and C++ with native OS threads:** These use predictable 1:1 thread models and are excellent candidates for thread-level containment. Process-level enforcement (`prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, ...)`) is universally portable regardless of thread model.

## Configuring Podman: The Custom Profile Approach

To enable nested seccomp stacking inside a container, you have two choices. 

1. **The "Unconfined" Hack (Discouraged):** Running with `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` disables the host-side seccomp sandbox entirely. This is often used in local development but is **highly discouraged for production environments** as it leaves the container boundary wide open to kernel-level attacks.

2. **The Hardened Custom Profile (Recommended):** Instead of running unconfined, you run your container with a **custom OCI seccomp JSON profile** that is identical to the standard profile but explicitly whitelists the installation syscalls. This project utilizes this approach via the `podman-seccomp.json` profile.

### Why a Custom Profile is Needed

**The actual blocker is Podman's default Seccomp profile.** By default, Podman blocks the `seccomp(2)` system call and restricts the `prctl(2)` system call arguments to prevent containers from modifying their own security filters. When the JVM inside a standard container attempts to call `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)` or `seccomp(SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER)`, the host kernel blocks the call at the outer Podman container boundary, causing an immediate `EPERM`.

By whitelisting `seccomp` and the necessary `prctl` flags in a custom profile, we maintain a robust container-level security floor (blocking access to dangerous host-level calls like `keyctl` or kernel namespace mutations) while empowering the JVM inside the container to dynamically apply its own unprivileged thread-level sandboxes.

### The Production Solution: Custom Podman JSON Profile

Specifically, the `podman-seccomp.json` profile provided in this repository ensures:

1. **`seccomp`**: Allowed with zero restrictions.
2. **`prctl`**: Allowed, specifically whitelisting `PR_SET_SECCOMP` (22) and `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` (38) in the arguments list.

This configuration is the architectural floor for `jseccomp`.

### Author's Analysis: Nested Seccomp in OCI Runtimes

> *The following is the author's architectural argument, not an established industry position.*

OCI runtimes (such as `runc`, `containerd`, Podman, and Docker) restrict the `seccomp(2)` system call and specific `prctl(2)` options within their default profiles. This design decision is part of a defense-in-depth strategy aimed at reducing the host kernel's attack surface, preventing untrusted processes within containers from interacting with the kernel's BPF verifier or constructing arbitrary syscall filters.

However, the necessity of this OCI-level block can be evaluated against kernel-level invariants:
1.  **Enforced State Monotonicity:** The Linux kernel strictly requires the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag to be set before an unprivileged process can load a seccomp filter. Once active, the process and all descendants are permanently barred from privilege transitions (such as setuid, setgid, or file capability elevations).
2.  **Filter Monotonicity:** Seccomp filters can only restrict the current syscall capabilities; they cannot be removed, bypassed, or relaxed by subsequent nested filters.
3.  **Kernel Limits:** Modern kernels cap seccomp filter depth and BPF program complexity, preventing simple kernel memory exhaustion vectors.

Given these kernel-level invariants, blocking unprivileged seccomp filter installation inside containers does not prevent privilege escalation, since the kernel already enforces an immutable boundary. The primary risk re-introduced by whitelisting `seccomp` and `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)` is a minor increase in BPF verifier exposure.

A potential architectural alternative for OCI specifications would be to permit nested filter installation by default whenever the container is configured with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` (which pre-emptively enforces `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`). This would allow secure, application-level sandboxing (such as thread-scoped containment) to be deployed natively within standardized container environments without requiring custom profiles.
