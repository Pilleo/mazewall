# Code Issues Backlog

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ FIXED: Profiler Protocol ACK Corruption
**Context:** In `Profiler.kt`, the deduplication block correctly uses `ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE` to write a 1-byte ACK (`0x41`). This was confirmed to be correctly implemented.

### ✅ FIXED: Profiler Socket Write Race Condition
**Context:** `ProfilerDaemon.sendTraceEvent` is synchronized on a per-socket lock to prevent interleaved writes from concurrent threads (Seccomp vs Landlock Audit).

### ✅ FIXED: Landlock Path Fallback Edge Case
**Context:** `Landlock.kt` correctly handles cases where `File(path).parent` is null (e.g., relative paths or root-level files) by defaulting to `/`.

### ✅ FIXED: Package Structure
**Context:** The project is already organized into `enforcer`, `landlock`, `profiler`, and `seccomp` packages.

### ✅ FIXED: `Policy.PURE_COMPUTE` Security Gaps
**Context:** Audited `PURE_COMPUTE` and verified that filesystem modification syscalls (`RENAME`, `LINK`, `UNLINK`, `CHMOD`, `CHOWN`, etc.) are ALREADY appropriately blocked in the policy definition.

### ✅ FIXED: AARCH64 Syscall Coverage
**Context:** Audited `Arch.kt` and `Syscall.kt`. Verified that modern `*at` variants (`renameat2`, `mkdirat`, `unlinkat`, `fchmodat`, `fchownat`, etc.) are ALREADY mapped correctly for ARM64 and accounted for in the blocking lists.

### ✅ FIXED: FFM Arena Allocation Performance
**Context:** Verified that `Profiler.kt` correctly wraps the `InputStream` in a `BufferedInputStream`, heavily mitigating `Arena` allocation pressure by performing 8KB bulk reads via overridden `read(byte[], int, int)` rather than 1-byte iterative downcalls. 

### ✅ FIXED: Profiler Daemon Path Resolution (AT_FDCWD)
**Context:** Fixed `ProfilerDaemon.getPathArgs` to properly parse `fd`-based syscalls like `FCHMOD`, `FCHOWN`, and `FSTAT` using `resolveFdPath` rather than misinterpreting the `fd` as a memory address. Implemented robust `AT_FDCWD` checks (accounting for unsigned 32-bit `0xFFFFFF9C` vs `-100L`).

### ✅ FIXED: Landlock Empty Intersection Bypass
**Context:** Fixed a severe bug in `Policy.combine` where stacking two restrictive policies with disjoint filesystem paths resulted in an `emptySet()`. Previously, this bypassed Landlock. Now, `Policy` utilizes an `enforceLandlock` boolean flag to ensure Landlock is forcefully applied (blocking all non-classpath access) when path intersections become disjoint.

## Remaining Issues

### 🔴 Critical: Profiler Connection Failure Deadlocks JVM Thread
**Context:** In `ProfilerInstaller.kt`, `connectWithRetry` is called outside the `try { ... } finally { ... }` block that closes the listener file descriptor `fd`. If `connectWithRetry` throws an exception (e.g., due to connection timeout or retry failure), the listener FD is leaked and never closed. Since the seccomp profiling filter has already been successfully installed on the worker thread, any subsequent system call on the worker thread (such as `proceedLatch.await()`, which invokes `futex`) will block permanently waiting for a daemon response that will never come, resulting in a fatal JVM deadlock.
**Needed:** Wrap the coordinator logic in a try-finally that guarantees the listener FD is closed if connection fails, or close the FD immediately when the coordinator thread encounters any uncaught exception before entering the main loop.

### 🔴 High: Landlock Path Fallback Over-Permission
**Context:** In `IterativeProfiler.kt`, reading a missing file inside a restricted directory triggers an `EACCES` denial. The profiler conservatively grants both Read and Write access. When `Landlock.kt` processes this rule, it falls back to applying the rule to the parent directory, resulting in full write access to the parent.
**Needed:** Re-evaluate the `IterativeProfiler` fallback strategy or explicitly handle missing files before passing them to Landlock.

### 🟡 Medium: Hierarchical Rule Stacking Validation
**Context:** In `ContainedExecutors.kt`, the check to prevent expanding existing Landlock permissions uses exact string matching (`containsAll`). This incorrectly throws an exception if a nested task requests a valid sub-path (e.g., `/tmp/foo` when `/tmp` is already allowed).
**Needed:** Replace exact string matching with a `startsWith`-based subset path evaluation.

### 🟡 Medium: Profiler Daemon Missing Null-Terminator Bounding
**Context:** In `ProfilerDaemon.kt`, `readStringFromProcess` copies up to 4096 bytes. If a malicious pointer lacks a null terminator within that window, the daemon copies the entire block as a string, processing garbage data.
**Needed:** Add a check to safely truncate or reject strings if the maximum length is reached without encountering a null byte.

### 🔴 High: Remove Deprecated Landlock Audit Logic
**Context:** The `MAZEWALL_PROFILER_AUDIT` logic in `Profiler.kt` and `Landlock.kt` is based on the false assumption that Landlock Audit is transparent. In reality, it causes `EACCES` crashes.
**Needed:** Rip out the `Landlock.applyProfilingRuleset()` and related Netlink socket code from the Tier S profiler to restore its transparency guarantee.

### 🔴 High: Implement Tier P (Privileged Profiler)
**Context:** High-performance `io_uring` profiling currently requires either the slow `IterativeProfiler` or a performance-degrading fallback to standard I/O.
**Needed:** A root-privileged profiler using eBPF tracepoints (`sys_enter_io_uring_setup`, etc.) or `strace` to achieve true transparent "Fast Path" profiling.

### 🟡 Medium: Expand `installOnProcess` Integration Coverage
**Context:** `ContainedExecutors.installOnProcess()` needs deeper validation (inheritance, JVM stability, depth accumulation).
**Needed:** Expanded test suite.
