# 🔴 [Severity: HIGH]: `IterativeProfiler` infinite retry loop and failure on disjoint prefix file paths

**Target:** `/profiler/src/main/kotlin/io/mazewall/profiler/iterative/IterativeProfiler.kt` (specifically `updatePolicyForViolation`)
**Failure Hypothesis:** The `IterativeProfiler` checks if read is already allowed using a naive string `startsWith` check. If the workload accesses a path whose prefix matches an already allowed path but is a different, longer directory name (e.g., `/var/log-extra` when `/var/log` is allowed), the check falsely returns `true`. The profiler then attempts to add a *write* rule instead of a *read* rule, causing subsequent read attempts to continue failing and forcing the profiler into an infinite discovery retry loop that aborts after 20 retries.
**Context & Proof:** If `currentPolicy` allowed read to `/var/log`, and a trapped read occurs on `/var/log-extra`, `isCurrentlyReadAllowed` evaluates to `true` (since `"/var/log-extra".startsWith("/var/log")` is true). So `updatePolicyForViolation` executes the `then` branch: `if (isCurrentlyReadAllowed) { builder.allowFsWrite(path) }`. Thus, it adds a write rule for `/var/log-extra` but NEVER adds a read rule! On the next retry, the thread tries to read `/var/log-extra` again, gets denied, and the same logic is executed. This continues until the retry count hits `maxRetries` (20), at which point the profiler crashes.
**Cascading Risk Potential:** High stability and usability bug. Blocks iterative profiling for applications with sibling directories sharing identical prefixes.
**Needed:** Use proper component-based `Path.startsWith` logic instead of raw string `startsWith`. Map the strings in `allowedFsReadPaths` to `Path` structures and normalize them, then compare using `java.nio.file.Path.startsWith`.
