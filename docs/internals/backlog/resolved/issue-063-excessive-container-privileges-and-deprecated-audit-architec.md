# 🔴 [Severity: MEDIUM]: Excessive container privileges and deprecated Audit architecture in compose.yml files

**Context:**
The SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS.md document clearly states that Landlock Audit is deprecated for transparent profiling because it lacks a permissive mode and causes EACCES crashes. It explicitly mandates an unprivileged profiling strategy (Tier H or Tier A). However, infra/dev/compose.yml still grants AUDIT_READ, AUDIT_CONTROL, network_mode: host, and userns_mode: host citing the deprecated Audit subsystem. Even worse, demos/vulnerable-web-app/compose.yml grants SYS_ADMIN and SYS_PTRACE, completely invalidating the claim that the demonstration runs in a restricted, unprivileged container environment. Furthermore, the demo compose file references a broken path ${PWD}/../../podman-seccomp.json.


**Needed:**
1. Implement a fix based on the issue description.

## Solution Options

### Option A — Refactor implementation
Implement the recommendation described in the Needed section to resolve the issue directly. Target area: `Unknown`
**Pros:** Resolves the root cause of the issue.
**Cons:** Requires careful implementation and testing.
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** small
