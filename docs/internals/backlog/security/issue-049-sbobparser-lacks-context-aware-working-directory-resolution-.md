# 🔴 [Severity: MEDIUM]: `SbobParser` lacks Context-Aware Working Directory resolution for Relative Paths

**Target:** `io.mazewall.SbobParser`
**Failure Hypothesis:** The `Profiler` runs in a staging environment where the JVM's Current Working Directory (CWD) is `/var/lib/staging`. An application accesses a file using a relative path, e.g., `config/settings.json`. The Profiler `tryRead` fails to resolve `dirfd` and falls back to logging the relative path `config/settings.json` into the `BillOfBehavior`. In production, the JVM's CWD is `/opt/app`. When `SbobParser` reads the SBoB, it calls `Paths.get("config/settings.json").toAbsolutePath().normalize()`, which resolves to `/opt/app/config/settings.json`.
**Context & Proof:** Landlock requires absolute paths. `SbobParser`'s `pruneSubpaths` method silently converts relative paths using the production JVM's CWD at the time of parsing. If the application actually intends to access a global relative path, or the profiler's CWD differs from the production CWD, the generated policy will allow the wrong absolute path.
**Vulnerability Chain Potential:** Medium usability and sandbox evasion failure. If a relative path is unintentionally permitted, and the production CWD is `/`, the policy might inadvertently allow access to `/config/settings.json`. This breaks deterministic policy portability across environments.
**Needed:**
1. `SbobParser` should warn or throw an error when attempting to parse a relative path, or it should accept an explicit `baseCwd` parameter to resolve relative paths deterministically rather than relying on the environmental JVM CWD at load time.
2. The Profiler should ensure all paths are fully resolved to absolute canonical paths *before* writing them to the SBoB, failing the profiler session if a `dirfd` cannot be resolved to an absolute path.
