# Technical Design: Containment Engine & Incremental Filter Stacking

This document covers the implementation details of the enforcement tier in `mazewall`:
how policies become live BPF filters, how filters stack incrementally, and how Landlock
integrates with the seccomp pipeline. Read this before modifying `ContainedExecutors.kt`,
`PureJavaBpfEngine.kt`, `BpfFilter.kt`, or `Landlock.kt`.

## 1. The Enforcement Pipeline

```
Policy (syscallActions: Map<Syscall, SeccompAction>, defaultAction: SeccompAction, allowMmapExec, ...)
    │
    ▼
BpfFilter.build(arch, policy)
    │  - architecture check prologue (AUDIT_ARCH_* constant)
    │  - clone3 ENOSYS trap (unconditional)
    │  - argument-inspection sequences for mmap/mprotect, clone, prctl
    │  - linear scan over restricted syscall numbers (sorted IntArray)
    │  - default ALLOW (DENY_LIST) or DENY (ALLOW_LIST) at the tail
    │
    ▼  List<BpfInstruction>
PureJavaBpfEngine.install(policy)  /  installOnProcess(policy)
    │  1. prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1)
    │  2. pack sock_fprog struct via FFM Arena
    │  3. syscall(seccomp, SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, flags, &prog)
    │  4. fallback: prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &prog)   [thread-local only]
    │  5. verify: prctl(PR_GET_SECCOMP) == 2
    │
    ▼
ContainedExecutors.installInternal(processWide, vararg policies)
    │  - deduplicates against THREAD_BLOCKED / PROCESS_BLOCKED state
    │  - enforces 32-filter depth limit
    │  - synchronized(processLock) to prevent TOCTOU race
    │  - updates thread-local or process-wide tracking state
```

### 1a. Architecture: Decoupled Transaction & Feature Detection

The enforcement engine follows a strict **Dependency Inversion** pattern to ensure testability and version-resiliency:

*   **TransactionManager:** The FFM `Arena` lifecycle and `NativeTransaction` boundaries are decoupled from `LinuxNative`. This allows `mazewall` to be tested using a `MockNativeEngine` without requiring a real Linux kernel, and enables future optimizations like thread-local arena pooling.
*   **KernelFeatureMatrix:** Instead of static version checks, `mazewall` uses a cached, probe-based `KernelFeatureMatrix` (via `Platform.featureMatrix`). This matrix detects capabilities like Seccomp TSYNC, Landlock ABI versions, and USER_NOTIF support at initialization, allowing the engine to fail-closed or safely degrade based on `FallbackBehavior`.
*   **SyscallInspectionPipeline:** Argument-inspection generation (for `mmap`, `clone`, etc.) is implemented as a pipeline (`SyscallInspectionPipeline`). This enforces the **Open/Closed Principle**, allowing new inspections (e.g., for `openat2`) to be added without modifying the core `BpfFilter` compiler.

---

## 2. Why a Linear BPF Scan (Not a BST)

BPF jump offsets are 8-bit unsigned integers — the maximum forward jump is 255 instructions.
A Binary Search Tree layout for even a moderately sized syscall set (e.g. `PURE_COMPUTE_UNSAFE`'s
~40 syscalls) can require jumps that exceed this limit, requiring complex instruction
rewriting or label patching.

The linear scan emits two instructions per restricted syscall number. The logic
is inverted based on the policy mode:

**DENY_LIST mode:**
```
BPF_JEQ(nr)  → jt=0, jf=1     # if nr matches: jt=0 (no skip) → fall into RET_DENY
BPF_RET(DENY)                  # if nr does not match: jf=1 (skip this RET_DENY)
```

**ALLOW_LIST mode:**
```
BPF_JEQ(nr)  → jt=0, jf=1     # if nr matches: jt=0 (no skip) → fall into RET_ALLOW
BPF_RET(ALLOW)                 # if nr does not match: jf=1 (skip this RET_ALLOW)
```

In Classic BPF, `jt` and `jf` are **instruction skip counts** (not jump labels).
`jt=0` means "if condition is true, skip 0 instructions" (execute the next instruction immediately).
`jf=1` means "if condition is false, skip 1 instruction" (skip over the `RET_DENY`).

For 40 syscalls this produces ~80 BPF instructions — far below both the 255-offset
and the 4096-instruction kernel BPF limits. Performance: BPF is evaluated in the kernel
before the syscall; the linear scan overhead is negligible compared to the syscall itself.

---

## 3. Argument-Inspection Sequences

`BpfFilter` does **not** block these syscalls by number — it emits multi-instruction
BPF sequences that inspect arguments. **Do not replace these sequences with simple
`BPF_JEQ` checks against the syscall number.** Doing so silently removes the nuanced
protections.

### 3a. `mmap` and `mprotect` — block `PROT_EXEC`

`struct seccomp_data` byte offsets: `nr`=0, `arch`=4, `instruction_pointer`=8 (8 bytes), `args[0]`=16, `args[1]`=24, `args[2]`=32, ...
For `mmap`/`mprotect`, `prot` is the 3rd argument → `args[2]` → **byte offset 32**.

```
BPF_JEQ(syscall_nr == mmap, match, skip_3)
BPF_LD offset=32                             # load args[2] (prot) lower 32 bits
BPF_JSET 0x04, match, skip_1               # (BPF_JMP|0x40|BPF_K): if PROT_EXEC bit set, jt=0 (deny); else jf=1 (skip deny)
BPF_RET(DENY)
# identical 3-instruction sequence for mprotect (syscall_nr == mprotect)
```

> **`JSET` semantics:** `jt=0, jf=1` — if `(ACC & 0x04) != 0` (PROT_EXEC IS set): jt=0, execute `RET_DENY` immediately; else: jf=1, skip over `RET_DENY`.

This blocks only `mmap` / `mprotect` calls where the caller requests executable memory.
The JVM's own JIT and GC `mmap`/`mprotect` calls do not use `PROT_EXEC` in the way
that shellcode injection does — they are whitelisted by this check automatically.

### 3b. `clone` — allow only `CLONE_THREAD`

`clone` flags are the 1st argument → `args[0]` → **byte offset 16**.
`CLONE_THREAD = 0x00010000`, `CLONE_VM = 0x00000100`, mask = `0x00010100`.

```
BPF_JEQ(syscall_nr == clone, match, skip_4)
BPF_LD offset=16                          # load args[0] (clone flags)
BPF_ALU|BPF_AND|BPF_K (0x54) 0x00010100  # mask to CLONE_VM | CLONE_THREAD
BPF_JEQ(0x00010100, skip_1, match)        # both bits set → JVM thread creation → skip deny
BPF_RET(DENY)
```

> **`BPF_AND` note:** There is no standalone `BPF_AND` opcode. This is `BPF_ALU | BPF_AND | BPF_K` = opcode `0x54`. The operand `K` is the mask value.

The JVM creates threads via `clone(CLONE_THREAD | CLONE_VM | CLONE_SIGHAND | ...)`.
Process forking (`fork`, `vfork`, or `clone` without `CLONE_THREAD`) hits `DENY`.
An agent who naively adds `Syscall.CLONE` to a policy's block list would bypass
this inspection and deadlock the JVM at the next thread creation.

### 3c. `clone3` — always return `ENOSYS`

`clone3` is blocked unconditionally with `ENOSYS` (not `EPERM`) to force libc to
fall back to the inspectable `clone`. This is not controlled by `allowNonThreadClone`.

### 3d. `prctl` — whitelist safe options

```
BPF_JEQ(syscall_nr == prctl, match, skip_8)
BPF_LD(args[0])                    # load option
BPF_JEQ(PR_SET_NAME (15), allow, ...)
BPF_JEQ(PR_GET_NAME (16), allow, ...)
BPF_JEQ(PR_GET_SECCOMP (21), allow, ...)
BPF_JEQ(PR_SET_SECCOMP (22), allow, ...)
BPF_JEQ(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS (38), allow, ...)
BPF_JEQ(PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS (39), allow, ...)
BPF_RET(DENY)
```

The JVM calls `prctl(PR_SET_NAME)` constantly for thread naming. Blocking `prctl`
outright (via `Syscall.PRCTL` in the block list) is **not safe and must never be done**:
it would block the whitelisted options and prevent `PR_SET_SECCOMP` from being called
during filter-stacking. The argument-inspection path above restricts `prctl` to the
safe subset while leaving installation and naming intact.

> **`allowUnsafePrctl = true`:** Setting this flag on the policy skips the argument
> inspection entirely, leaving `prctl` unrestricted. Only use this when filter stacking
> is explicitly required beyond the whitelisted options.

### 3e. Intentionally Unrestricted JVM Syscalls

The following syscalls are **deliberately not present in any argument-inspection sequence
or block-list**. They are left completely unrestricted because blocking them causes
catastrophic JVM instability:

| Syscall        | Reason left unrestricted                                                                                                                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `futex`        | JVM thread parking/unparking and monitor synchronization. Blocking causes deadlock at the next `synchronized` block or `Object.wait()`. |
| `sched_yield`  | Thread scheduler cooperation during spinlock contention.                                                                                |
| `rt_sigreturn` | Return from JVM signal handlers (HotSpot uses `SIGSEGV` for safepoint polling). Blocking causes instant JVM abort.                      |
| `rt_sigaction` | HotSpot installs its own signal handlers at JVM init. Blocking prevents the JVM from starting.                                          |
| `madvise`      | GC page lifecycle management (ZGC, G1).                                                                                                 |
| `gettid`       | Thread identification used by GC and diagnostic paths.                                                                                  |
| `close`        | JVM and FFM close file descriptors constantly. Blocking causes fd leaks and runtime instability.                                        |

Do not add any of these to a policy's block-list. See `designs/core/security-considerations.md §9`
for the full safepoint/GC deadlock analysis.

### 3f. `allowMmapExec = false` Is a Hidden Default for ALL Policies

`allowMmapExec` defaults to `false` on every `Policy.Builder`, including **DENY_LIST**
(default-ALLOW) policies like `NO_NETWORK` and `NO_EXEC`. Regardless of a policy's
`defaultAction`, if `allowMmapExec` is `false`, the BPF program emits the `mmap(PROT_EXEC)`
argument-inspection sequence that blocks `mmap` calls with the `PROT_EXEC` bit set.

**Consequence for process-wide installation**: When `ContainedExecutors.installOnProcess()`
is called with any policy where `allowMmapExec = false`, the BPF filter applies to **all
threads**, including the JVM's JIT compiler background threads. The JIT compiler allocates
code-cache pages via `mmap(PROT_EXEC)`. These calls are blocked, causing:

```
os::commit_memory(addr, size, 1) failed; error='Operation not permitted' (errno=1)
# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map N bytes.
# JVM crashes fatally.
```

**Correct pattern when blocking network but NOT JIT:**
```kotlin
// WRONG — kills the JIT compiler process-wide:
ContainedExecutors.installOnProcess(Policy.NO_NETWORK)

// CORRECT — restricts network, leaves JIT alone:
ContainedExecutors.installOnProcess(
    Policy.builder().base(Policy.NO_NETWORK).allowMmapExec().build()
)
```

The preset `NO_EXEC` explicitly documents this. `NO_NETWORK` and any custom DENY_LIST
policy must be treated with equal care.

### 3g. ALLOW_LIST Policies and Lazy Class Loading

When a policy uses `defaultAction = ACT_ERRNO` (allow-list mode), all syscalls not in the
explicit allow set are blocked — including `openat` and `open`. The JVM loads classes
lazily: a class is only loaded from its `.jar` via `openat` the first time it is referenced.

**Consequence**: If `openat` is not in the allow-list, **any class not yet loaded at filter
installation time cannot be loaded afterward**. This produces:

```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: io/mazewall/seccomp/SeccompInstallationState$Failed
```

even though the class is on the classpath. The class loader makes an `openat` call,
which is blocked, causing `ClassNotFoundException`, which is wrapped as `NoClassDefFoundError`.

**Rule**: When writing code that will execute under an ALLOW_LIST policy that excludes
`openat`, all classes that code will reference must be explicitly touched (loaded)
**before** the filter is installed. This is distinct from `JitWarmup` (which was a
misguided global warm-up): this is **targeted pre-loading of the specific class graph**
that will execute under the restricted policy.

```kotlin
// Pre-load all internal state classes before installing the ALLOW_LIST filter.
SeccompInstallationState.Failed::class.java       // touched → loaded now
SeccompInstallationState.Verified::class.java     // touched → loaded now
// ... install ALLOW_LIST filter ...
// SeccompInstallationState.Failed can now be instantiated without openat.
```

This requirement does NOT apply to `PURE_COMPUTE` (which uses Landlock for filesystem
enforcement and does not block `openat` in the BPF filter), or to any DENY_LIST policy
(where `openat` is allowed by the default-ALLOW action).

---

## 4. Incremental Filter Stacking

### Why stacking exists

Seccomp filters are monotonic: once a syscall is blocked on a thread, it cannot be
unblocked. The kernel accumulates filters in a linked list; each new filter is evaluated
in order, and the most-restrictive result wins. `ContainedExecutors` stacks filters
incrementally to allow multiple `installOnCurrentThread` calls (e.g. from nested
executor wrapping or the profiler) without wasting filter slots.

### How deduplication works

`ContainedExecutors` maintains an immutable **`ContainerState`** data class, updated atomically via `ThreadStateRegistry` (ThreadLocal) and `ProcessStateRegistry` (AtomicReference). This ensures a consistent view of the sandbox state across concurrent installations.

Before installing, `installInternal` computes:
- `newBlocks`: Syscalls in the new policy that map to a *higher priority (more restrictive) action* than the currently installed action.
- `needsMmapProtection`, `needsCloneProtection`, `needsPrctlProtection`: Gates for argument-inspection blocks.

**Optimization (Optimized Stacking):** Seccomp BPF filters are additive. If a previous filter already restricts `mmap(PROT_EXEC)`, non-thread `clone`, or unsafe `prctl` calls, `FilterInstallationPlanner` skips compiling duplicate argument-inspection blocks for these syscalls in the new stacked filter, preserving kernel instruction memory and the 32-filter depth budget.


### The `synchronized(processLock)` requirement

The deduplication check and the state update are inside `synchronized(processLock)`.
This prevents two threads from simultaneously calculating "this syscall is not yet
blocked" and both installing redundant filters, which would waste depth slots.
**Do not remove or weaken this lock.**

### The 32-filter depth limit

The kernel hard limit is 32 seccomp filters per thread (thread-local + process-wide combined).
- Depth ≥ 32: `IllegalStateException` is thrown before the install.
- Depth > 10: a `WARNING` log is emitted. Do not suppress this.

Exceeding 32 causes the next `seccomp()` call to return `EINVAL`, silently leaving
the policy partially unenforced. The current limit of 32 is enforced by the kernel
regardless of any library-level tracking.

### Process-wide vs. thread-local path

```
installOnProcess()  →  PureJavaBpfEngine.installOnProcess()
    - uses SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC
    - TSYNC synchronises the new filter to **all threads in the same thread group,
      including those created after the call**
    - if seccomp(2) + TSYNC fails → throws `IllegalStateException` immediately;
      **never falls back to thread-local installation**
    - Kernel 5.7+ changed TSYNC semantics: pre-5.7, any mismatch returns `EINVAL`;
      5.7+ returns `EINVAL` only for true incompatibilities. In all cases,
      `mazewall` treats any TSYNC failure as a hard error.
    - updates PROCESS_BLOCKED, PROCESS_FILTER_DEPTH, PROCESS_ALLOWS_* atomics

installOnCurrentThread()  →  PureJavaBpfEngine.install()
    - uses flags=0 (thread-local only)
    - falls back to prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP) on old kernels
    - updates THREAD_BLOCKED, FILTER_DEPTH, THREAD_ALLOWS_* ThreadLocals
```

`SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC` and `SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_NEW_LISTENER` are mutually
exclusive. `NEW_LISTENER` is used exclusively by `Profiler`. Never combine them.

---

## 5. Landlock Integration

### Ordering requirement

Landlock installation calls `landlock_create_ruleset(2)`, `landlock_add_rule(2)`,
and `landlock_restrict_self(2)` — all standard syscalls. If seccomp is installed
first with a policy that blocks `openat` (e.g. `PURE_COMPUTE_UNSAFE`), these Landlock
syscalls fail before Landlock can activate.

**Enforced order in `ContainedExecutors.ContainedExecutorWrapper.applyContainment()`:**
1. `Landlock.applyRuleset(policy)`    ← first
2. `installOnCurrentThread(policy)`   ← second

Do not change this order.

### Per-thread application (THREAD_LANDLOCK_APPLIED_*)

`THREAD_LANDLOCK_APPLIED_READS` and `THREAD_LANDLOCK_APPLIED_WRITES` are `ThreadLocal<Set<String>?>`
that ensure the Landlock ruleset is applied only when the requested paths are not already covered
by an existing domain. Applying it a second time on the same thread creates a second
intersective Landlock domain that **narrows** permissions further. This can block JVM
classpath reads and cause `NoClassDefFoundError` at unpredictable points during lazy classloading.

### ABI version negotiation

Landlock `Landlock.kt` negotiates the highest ABI version the running kernel supports
via `landlock_create_ruleset(size=0, flags=LANDLOCK_CREATE_RULESET_VERSION)`. Using
a feature flag from a newer ABI than the kernel supports **silently drops those rules**
without returning an error. Always document the minimum ABI version required when
adding new Landlock access-right flags.

### JVM classpath whitelist (`allowJvmClasspath()`)

If Landlock is active and a restricted thread triggers lazy classloading of a class
whose `.jar` file is not in the allowed read paths, the kernel returns `EACCES` and
the JVM throws `NoClassDefFoundError`. `Policy.Builder.allowJvmClasspath()` reads
`java.home` and `java.class.path` at policy-build time to prevent this.

Always call `allowJvmClasspath()` when writing tests that activate Landlock on a
thread that may still lazy-load test infrastructure classes.

### Landlock TSYNC (ABI 8 / Linux 7.0+)

Historically, Landlock rulesets were strictly thread-scoped and could not be applied retroactively to sibling threads. To lock down a multi-threaded JVM process on older kernels, a wrapper launcher (e.g., C or Rust) must apply the ruleset before invoking `execve` on the JVM.

Linux 7.0 (ABI 8) introduces `LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_TSYNC` which synchronizes the ruleset to all existing threads in the process atomically. However, `mazewall` keeps this flag **disabled by default** (always passing `flags=0L` during enforcement ruleset application) due to:
1. **Sibling Thread Transparency:** The JIT compiler and GC worker threads often require system path permissions that sandboxed application threads lack. Retroactive lockdown causes process deadlocks or aborts.
2. **Test Suite Collisions:** TSYNC sandboxes the parent Gradle worker process during execution, crashing completely unrelated sibling tests with `AccessDeniedException`.

### `applyRestrictiveBarrier()` vs. `applyRuleset(policy)`

- `applyRuleset(policy)` — enforcement path; used by `ContainedExecutors`.
- `applyRestrictiveBarrier()` — applies a restrictive Landlock domain. This is used by the **Iterative Profiler (Tier A)** to trigger path denials that are then caught and resolved. In older design iterations, it was used with `MAZEWALL_PROFILER_AUDIT=true` to trigger kernel audit events, but this is now deprecated for transparent profiling as Landlock lacks a permissive mode.

## 6. `PureJavaBpfEngine` Installation Sequence

For reference: the exact steps performed by `PureJavaBpfEngine.installInternal()`:

```
1. prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1)         → required before any unprivileged seccomp call
2. Arch.current()                         → resolve arch (x86_64 / aarch64)
3. BpfFilter.build(arch, policy)          → compile BPF program
4. Arena.ofConfined().use { arena ->
     LinuxNative.newSockFProg(arena, filters)   → pack sock_fprog struct (FFM)
     syscall(seccompNr, SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, flags, &prog)
   }
5a. If syscall returns 0 → success
5b. If thread-local and syscall fails:
       prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &prog)  ← older kernel fallback
    If process-wide (TSYNC) and syscall fails → IllegalStateException (no fallback)
6. prctl(PR_GET_SECCOMP) == 2             → verify filter is active
   (skipped if Syscall.PRCTL is in the blocked set — prctl would be blocked)
```

---

## 7. FFM Struct Layouts

All off-heap structs are allocated via `Arena.ofConfined()` to ensure automatic
deallocation at the end of the scope. Key layouts:

### `sock_filter` (8 bytes)
```
offset 0: code  (short / JAVA_SHORT, 2 bytes)
offset 2: jt    (byte  / JAVA_BYTE,  1 byte)
offset 3: jf    (byte  / JAVA_BYTE,  1 byte)
offset 4: k     (int   / JAVA_INT,   4 bytes)   ← MUST be JAVA_INT, not JAVA_LONG
```

### `sock_fprog` (16 bytes on x86_64)
```
offset 0: len     (short / JAVA_SHORT, 2 bytes)  — number of sock_filter instructions
offset 2: padding (6 bytes for alignment)
offset 8: filter  (address / ValueLayout.ADDRESS, 8 bytes)  — pointer to sock_filter array
```

Getting `k` wrong (using `JAVA_LONG` instead of `JAVA_INT`) produces a silently-corrupt
BPF program. The kernel BPF verifier may or may not catch this depending on the values
involved — it is not safe to rely on the verifier as a correctness check.

---

## 8. `errno` Capture Pattern

```kotlin
// Correct pattern (from LinuxNative.kt):
val capturedState = CAPTURED_STATE_LAYOUT.allocate(arena)
val handle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
    addr,
    descriptor,
    Linker.Option.captureCallState("errno")
)
val result = handle.invokeWithArguments(capturedState, ...)
val errno = capturedState.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, errnoOffset)
// Read errno BEFORE any other FFM call — the captured state is not thread-safe
// across multiple calls.
```

Do not call `Native.getLastError()` — this method does not exist in the standard
JDK FFM API. Do not read errno after performing another FFM downcall, as the
captured state segment reflects only the most recent call.

---

## 9. Logging & Metrics inside a Sandboxed Thread

Applying strict sandboxing rules (like `Policy.PURE_COMPUTE_UNSAFE` or restricted Landlock paths) to individual worker threads introduces a critical operational challenge: **logging and metrics execution**.

### The Problem
If a sandboxed task thread attempts to execute synchronous logging or metrics updates (e.g., standard file writes, TCP/UDP socket transmissions, or JMX updates):
1. The kernel intercepts the filesystem write (`write`, `writev`) or network system call (`sendto`, `sendmsg`, `connect`).
2. The system call is aborted, returning `EPERM` or `EACCES`.
3. The sandboxing engine catches this and throws a `ContainmentViolationException`, crashing the task prematurely.

### The Solution: Asynchronous Logging & Metrics
To avoid crashing JVM tasks when logging under a sandboxed thread, you must ensure that all logging and telemetry output is decoupled from the task execution thread:

* **In-Memory Decoupling**: The sandboxed task thread must write its log events and metrics data directly to an in-memory queue (e.g., a lock-free Log4j2 `Disruptor` ring buffer, a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, or a lock-free telemetry buffer).
* **Out-of-Process / Helper Thread Offloading**: An unrestricted, uncontained background helper thread (which runs outside the thread-scoped sandbox) consumes the events from the queue and performs the actual systems-level I/O operations (writing to the disk or pushing metrics over network sockets).

---

## 10. Future Roadmap: Process-Wide Namespaces & cgroups (Tier 1 Expansion)

To reinforce process-wide (Tier 1) security boundaries without breaking JVM thread orchestration, the roadmap includes introducing optional native integrations for **Linux Namespaces** and **cgroups**:

1. **Process-Wide Namespaces (Mount / Network / PID):**
   - **Why:** Running the entire JVM within its own dedicated namespaces at startup establishes a physical boundary that mitigates ACE escapes to the host.
   - **Implementation:** Leveraged strictly at startup/initialization (Tier 1) via a custom native launcher or early process bootstrap (e.g., via `unshare` before JVM thread pool creation). Thread-local namespace isolation is explicitly avoided due to GC signal routing and thread-dumping breakages.
2. **cgroups v2 Resource Restrictions:**
   - **Why:** Mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (e.g., CPU exhaustion, memory ballooning) initiated by sandboxed tasks.
   - **Implementation:** Bind the JVM process or specific system cgroup slices to strict resource boundaries at initialization.

---

## 11. Experimental: Stacktrace-Enforced Scoping (L4 Call-Path Binding)

In addition to static syscall filtering, `mazewall` supports dynamic **Stacktrace-Enforced Scoping** (using `StacktraceScopingPolicy` and `JvmStackInspector`). This binds a system call's permission check to the calling JVM execution stack trace in real time.

### The Safepoint Deadlock Problem
* Thread creation (`Thread.start()`) and process spawning (`ProcessBuilder.start()`) both rely on `clone` (or `clone3`) syscalls under the hood.
* When a syscall is supervised under `USER_NOTIF`, the kernel suspends the tracee thread.
* The supervisor must obtain the JVM stacktrace of the suspended thread using `Thread.getStackTrace()`. This forces a JVM safepoint.
* However, because the tracee thread is suspended in `Thread.start()` holding internal classloader and thread monitors, it cannot reach the safepoint.
* This results in a permanent circular deadlock.

### The JVM-Independent Solution (BPF-Level Separation & State-Based Propagation)

Rather than relying on JVM-specific configuration arguments (like `-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=vfork`), `mazewall` implements a clean, system-level design to enforce stacktrace-based scoping for process spawning safely:

1. **BPF-Level Clone Flag Inspection (Preventing Deadlocks):**
   JVM thread creation (`Thread.start()`) utilizes the `clone`/`clone3` syscalls with the `CLONE_THREAD` flag (value `0x00010000`). Blocking or suspending this path results in JVM-internal deadlocks.
   The BPF program is configured to inspect `clone` flags and **unconditionally allow** calls where `CLONE_THREAD` is set. Non-thread-creating `clone` calls (which indicate process creation, such as those from `posix_spawn`), along with `fork` and `vfork`, are routed to `USER_NOTIF`.

2. **Parent Stack Trace Capture on Spawn Entry:**
   When the parent JVM thread ($T_{parent}$) calls `vfork`, `fork`, or a process-spawning `clone`:
   - The seccomp filter traps the entry.
   - The JVM validation listener captures the stack trace of $T_{parent}$ and registers $T_{parent}$'s TID in a global `PendingSpawnRegistry` with its authorized stack trace before allowing the syscall to continue.

3. **State-Based Propagation on Child `execve`:**
   When the child process ($PID_{child}$) calls `execve`/`execveat` to run the target binary:
   - The seccomp filter intercepts `execve`.
   - The supervisor daemon reads `PPID` from `/proc/$PID_{child}/stat` to verify it is a descendant of the JVM.
   - Because the parent thread is suspended by the kernel in `vfork` or `clone(CLONE_VFORK)` until the child calls `execve` or exits, the spawning parent thread is guaranteed to be in the `PendingSpawnRegistry`.
   - The JVM validation listener queries the registry to retrieve the parent thread's authorized stack trace and validates the execution context.
   - Once the child execs, the parent thread returns and is removed from the `PendingSpawnRegistry`.

This ensures process spawning validation is 100% secure, JVM-independent, and free of thread-creation deadlocks.
