# Skill: Report Security Issue

This skill provides a standardized protocol for documenting a newly discovered security bypass, architectural gap, or kernel-level nuance in `mazewall`.

## Protocol

### 1. Classification
Determine the severity based on the following impact criteria:
- **CRITICAL:** Remote execution bypass, trivial sandbox escape without ACE.
- **HIGH:** Local privilege escalation within the sandbox, bypass of core whitelists (e.g. `NO_EXEC`).
- **MEDIUM:** Information leak, bypass requiring complex prerequisites, significant usability flaw.
- **LOW:** Documentation drift, minor performance degradation, nitpicks.

### 2. Documentation Phase
Add a new entry to **`docs/internals/code_issues_backlog.md`** using the following structured template:

```markdown
### 🔴 [Severity]: [Descriptive Title]
**Target:** [File paths and symbols involved]
**Context:** [Detailed description of the vulnerability, including why it exists and why current checks fail.]
**Failure Hypothesis:** [Optional: Steps to reproduce or the logical flow of the bypass.]
**Needed:** [Concrete technical recommendation for the fix.]
```

### 3. Safety Invariants
- **Fail Closed:** Ensure the recommended fix follows the "Fail Closed" doctrine.
- **No Silent Bypasses:** Do not suggest "fail-safe" or "warning-only" fixes for security boundaries.
- **Verification:** Always recommend a specific test case that can verify the fix.

### 4. Cross-Reference
If the issue affects both `:enforcer` and `:profiler`, ensure the entry covers both modules and explains the synchronization requirement.
