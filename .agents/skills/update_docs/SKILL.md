# Skill: Update Documentation

## Protocol

This skill provides a protocol for keeping design and internal documentation in sync with architectural changes.

### 1. Identify Change Impact
- **Code Change:** Analyze the code modification (e.g., refactoring `ContainerStateRegistry`, changing a `Policy` preset).
- **Find References:** Search `docs/internals/*.md` and `presentation/*.md` for symbols or concepts affected by the change.

### 2. Verify Drift
- **Compare:** Compare the current code behavior with the claims made in the documentation.
- **Identify Gaps:** Look for renamed methods, changed thread-local variables, or updated security invariants that are no longer accurately described.

### 3. Synchronize (Readability & Modularity)
- **Update Design Docs:** Modify `designs/enforcer/containment-design.md` or `designs/profiler/profiler-design.md` to reflect the new reality. Ensure the logic is modularly described.
- **Update presentation:** If the change affects how developers interact with the library, update the relevant files in `docs/presentation/`.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure that the same terminology is used across code, KDocs, and Markdown files. Terminology must be precise and consistent with the established `NativeEngine` trait nomenclature.
- **Readability:** Ensure that updated documentation remains accessible and free of jargon that hasn't been defined.

### 4. Backlog Audit
- **Check Backlog:** Scan `docs/internals/backlog/` category directories (specifically `code_health` or `testing`) and [backlog/README.md](file:///home/leanid/Documents/code/java/jseccomp/docs/internals/backlog/README.md) for "Documentation Drift" entries.
- **Resolve:** If your change resolves an existing drift entry, set `status: "resolved"` in its YAML frontmatter, move the issue file to `docs/internals/backlog/resolved/`, and update its registration status in [backlog/README.md](file:///home/leanid/Documents/code/java/jseccomp/docs/internals/backlog/README.md).
